# BTS_GlucoSym

## Overview
GlucoSym_BTS is a Python-based tool for processing glucose time-series data to isolate the postprandial glucose response (PPGR). It integrates signal processing, ODE-based physiological modeling, optimization, statistical correlation analysis, and hierarchical clustering to study blood glucose dynamics. Designed for metabolic research and data science applications in glycemic variability.

## Features
- PPGR isolation from raw glucose signals
- ODE-based simulation of glucose-insulin dynamics
- Statistical analysis (correlations, ANOVA, non-parametric tests)
- Hierarchical clustering of glucose response patterns
- Multiprocessing for large dataset handling

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
