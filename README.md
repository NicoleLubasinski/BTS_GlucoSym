# BTS_GlucoSym

## Overview
GlucoSym_BTS processes glucose measurements to isolate postprandial glucose response (PPGR) and perform simulation-based analysis. It combines data preprocessing, physiological modeling, optimization, and clustering to support metabolic research.

## Features
- PPGR isolation from raw glucose signals
- ODE-based simulation of glucose-insulin dynamics
- Statistical analysis (correlations, ANOVA, non-parametric tests)
- Hierarchical clustering of glucose response patterns
- Multiprocessing for large dataset handling

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
